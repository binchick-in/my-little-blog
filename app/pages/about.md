Bay Area native, engineering generalist of sorts. I'm always tinkering and exploring to learn new skills. This site serves as a sort of portfolio and resume covering what I'm working on.

I'm currently working as a corporate engineer in San Francisco. My team manages all the systems other employees use on a daily basis. We also develop custom software in house to solve problems off the shelf solutions don't cover.
