            <a href="https://github.com/binchick-in/my-little-blog" target="_blank">My Little Blog</a> is my personal site project!
            It is a site written in Python using the <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/" target="_blank">Flask</a> framework
            and runs inside a Docker container. Nginx is configured as a reverse proxy and serves inbound traffic to the container.
            The details of this setup are/will be highlighted here in the various pages of the blog <a href="/posts">posts</a> section.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything on this site is a work in progress!
        </p>
