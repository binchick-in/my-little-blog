The perceived value of photos is arguably a lot less these days than in the past. We all have smartphones capable of capturing hundreds of photos every minute, most of which never see the light of day, banished to the void of deletion. The ones that are shared are cheapened with cookie cutter filters on Instagram to give them the appearance of uniqueness.

I recently pulled out my film cameras. A [Nikon FE2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_FE2) with a [Nikkor 50mm 1.8](https://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/50f18E.htm) lens and a [Holga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holga) 120, CFN model. The last time I shot with these was in college and I remember it being the most fun I've had with a camera. Of course I also have a digital camera, a [Nikon D60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D60), but a film camera gives you a sense of excitement when taking photos. You don't get to see what you just photographed until you develop, you hear the mechanical shutter inside, you feel the 35mm roll of film move when you pull the film advance lever. You also don't just go around hitting the shutter button willy nilly since you have a limited number of shots, and you have to pay to develop those shots. This increases the value of the photos you take, in that, each photo is more purposeful and shot with intend. Film also has a genuine feel to the images it produces, there is a specific look to a photo that just looks tangible and organic.

### inb4 `hipster`
Yes, let me go on and on about how awsome film is with my `retro` and `toy` cameras and my `<insert other hipster nonsense>`. But I honeslty think we are going to see a resurgence (albeit small) of film in the coming years. Instant film is already seeing this revival with the Fuji Film Instax series of cameras. I hope that some portion of the upcoming generation can detach from the digital world, even as a small side hobby, and appreciate what film has to offer.

I want to begin shooting more film in the coming months and I'll definitely be sharing the results here as I develop this site further.

### Some shots with the Nikon FE2

Some shots to highlight what film can look like. These are all from the first roll of film I ever shot on the FE2. I was mainly playing around to see what was possible.
